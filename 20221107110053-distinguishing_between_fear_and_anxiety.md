The functionalist perspective on emotions considers fear and anxiety to be
meaningfully distinct even though they seem highly synonymous (Barlow, 2000;
Blakemore & Vuilleumier, 2017; Cheung-Blundin et al., 2019; Darwin, 1872;
Fontaine & Scherer, 2013; Frijda, 2007; Lazarus, 1999; Levenson, 2011; Shuman,
Clark-Polner, Meuleman, Sander, & Scherer, 2017). 

Fear and anxiety are highly comorbid (Helbig-Lang & Petermann, 2010; Perkins &
Corr, 2006; Shen & Bigsby, 2010; van Uijen & Toffolo, 2015).

This distinction is important in the realm of cyber security because fear vs.
anxiety can lead to differences in securiity behavior (Cheung-Blundin et al.,
2019; for more, see [[20221107101019-impacts_of_anxiety_fear_on_security.md]]).

The introduction of Cheung-Blundin et al. (2019) has a great review of the
functionalist perspective of emotion generally and of fear and anxiety
specifically. They cover some literature suggesting that fear identifies
imminent threats and flees, freezes, hides, etc. Fearful users may "avoid e-commerce, shun social media, [or] adopt air-gap defensive measures".
They characterize anxiety as amore complex emotion because it requires intelligence in the form of memory and imagination to worry about future outcomes. Anxious users may be "hypervigilant, reassurance-seeking, [and] compulsively check [devices]".
- While fear leads people to increase the distance between them and the perceived threat, anxiety closes that gap to survey the threat in a consistent manner
- While it may not be significant for behavior, fear may be further broken down into realistic fears and unrealistic (or paranoid) fears. This is an important distinction in the study of cyber-security fears as the novelty and ambiguity of cyberspace lends itself to a wide range of these two types of fears.
