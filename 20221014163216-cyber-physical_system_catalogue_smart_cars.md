Smart cars are a type of cyber-physical system (CPS) that can transform the typical process of operating a car into a more efficient, and less effortful experience. Smart cars contain, on top of the communicative systems of "dumb" cars (e.g., engine control units, brake systems, door locks, etc.) embedded sensors that communicate with the road and the objects/people found on them, computer vision, AI, and more computer processing power [1]. Additionally, some roads have the potential to communicate back and forth with smart cars. For example, traffic lights may be able to transmit information smart to cars so they can take the proper action depending on the light's status.

Estimates [2] show that around 90% of automobile accidents are a result of human error, and may be mitigated with the use of  "smart" cars which are always (when working as intended, see: [[20221014112036-smart_car_vulnerability]] for the alternative) logical agents.
