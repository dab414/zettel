A guiding framework of cyber physical systems consists of:

* Conceptualization
    * Brainstorming the structure and function of the system
* Realization
    * How is the system going to be implemented?
* Assurance
    * Validation; how to ensure the system is doing what it's supposed to be doing

Framework comes from burns et al., 2018. There are more figures in that paper that I havent parsed.
