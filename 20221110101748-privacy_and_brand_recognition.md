There is some evidence to suggest that people are likely to offload concerns about privacy to the brand of the technology that they're dealing with. 

An example of offloading privacy concerns to brands comes in the domain of
smart homes (Zheng et al., 2018), where, via semi-structured interviews, people report that brand
was a strong factor in their decision to adopt the technology, and that they
place a high level of trust in the brand to not act maliciously with their
data. In some cases, people rationalize their unwillingness to take privacy measures by referring to trust in manufacturers. 

Zheng et al. (2018) make the point that it's not clear that people would do
anything to protect their privacy even if they didn't trust the brand. They
argue that people have such strong desires for convenience (see
[[20221110100323-privacy_and_convenience.md]] or
[[20221012105222-effort_demand_avoidance.md]]) and since protecting privacy is
actually a lot of work, that people offload privacy concerns to manufacturers
because it's an easy way to avoid justifying putting in the effort.
