There are two main ways of creating materials in manufacturing (sreeramagiri et al.,
2002):
* machining (ie, subtractive manufacturing)
    * removing material to make final product
    * more like fine tuning, shaping is more important (conversation with ganesh)
* additive manufacturing
    * adds material in layers to make final product
    * how layers gel and come together is more important than shape (conversation with
        ganesh)
    * more involved in the cyber space (ganesh)
