Types of human error (Reason, 1990):

The emphasis here should be on security vulnerabilities of the *system* that
arise because of human behavior. At present (2022-12-15) it's a bit unclear
how the content I have here is distinguishable from the topic covered in
[[20220920111058-human_security_vulnerability_causes_CPS.md]].

* Execution
    * Error of commission
	* In the example of users, clicking on a link from a phishing email
    * Error of omission
        * Includes acting with mixed intention
	* Failure to adopt reasonable security practices

* Planning
    * Rule-based mistake
        * A rule can either be incorrect or incorrectly applied
    * Knowledge-based mistake
        * Error stemming from incomplete or incorrect knowledge

As summarized in Ceesay et al (2018).

Overlaps to an extent with Ganesh's summary of human errors in manufacturing
[[20220919133525-human_security_concerns_manufacturing.md]].

Another foreseeable source of error would be having decision making or
cognition generally compromised by an attack in some way (see
[[20220919095957-cognitive_targets_of_attack.md]]). This could give rise to a
scenario where someone is, for example, making an appropriate decision in
response to bad data, which leads to negative consequences. Whether this can be
considered as a "human error" per se is unclear.
