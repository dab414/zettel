While no prior (known) research has developed a scale specifically measuring people's concern around cybersecurity as it relates to the ultimate consequences of different types of cyber-attacks, there are many adjacent inventories. Below are a number of  scales with varying levels of relevance to the topic of concern around cyber-attack consequences, ordered loosely by relevance.

### Table of Contents:
- Ever-present threats from information technology: the Cyber-Paranoia and Fear Scale
- Anxiety as a Barrier to Information Processing in the Event of a Cyberattack
- Assessing Users’ Privacy and Security Concerns of Smart Home Technologies
- Emotional Experiences of Cybersecurity Breach Victims
- Computer Self-Efficacy and Anxiety Scales for an Internet Sample: Testing Measurement Equivalence of Existing Measures and Development of New Scales
- Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Scale: an Initial Application in Predicting Motivated Learning Behavior

###### Ever-present threats from information technology: the Cyber-Paranoia and Fear Scales

![alt text](cyber_paranoia_fear_scale.jpg)
- The first six items here were written to measure *paranoid* fears around information technology, while the latter five measure *realistic* fears

----------------------------------------------------------------
##### Anxiety as a Barrier to Information Processing in the Event of a Cyberattack

![alt text](emotions_around_cyber-attack_scale.jpg)
- Following exposure to a visual news story about a cyber-attack, participants took these modified pre-existing inventories to measure their levels of anxiety, anger, and fear around the presented information
----------------------------------------------------------------
##### Assessing Users’ Privacy and Security Concerns of Smart Home Technologies

![alt text](privacy_&_security_concerns_of_smart_home_tech_scale.jpg)
- Types of cybersecurity attack concerns (attack-unrelated, attack-related devices, attack-related data) were categorized by the themes that arose most prevalent in interviews, with quote examples of how these themes were extracted/coded
----------------------------------------------------------------
##### Emotional Experiences of Cybersecurity Breach Victims

![alt text](emotions_following_cyber-security_breach_scale.jpg)
- Scale measuring participants' reflection of a prior experienced cybersecurity breach in terms of the "appraisals, action tendencies, bodily reactions, expressions, subjective feelings, and regulation attempts" that occured
----------------------------------------------------------------
##### Computer Self-Efficacy and Anxiety Scales for an Internet Sample: Testing Measurement Equivalence of Existing Measures and Development of New Scales

![alt text](computer_self_efficacy_&_anxiety_scale.jpg)
- Sixteen items centered around self-report feelings of anxiety and self-efficacy when using computers
----------------------------------------------------------------
##### Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Scale: an Initial Application in Predicting Motivated Learning Behavior

![alt text](AI_anxiety_scale.jpg)
- Instrument measuring anxiety around AI (with some potentially concerning conflation of anxiety and fear-related vocabulary)
