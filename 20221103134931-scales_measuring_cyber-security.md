Below are a number of scales from previous research looking into various aspects of cyber concern. We tried to select scales that focused on the negative emotional aspects of concern, such as fear and anxiety.

### Cyber-Paranoia and Fear Scale

**Title: Ever-present threats from information technology: the Cyber-Paranoia and Fear Scales**

![alt text](cyber_paranoia_fear_scale.jpg)
- The first six items here were written to measure *paranoid* fears around information technology, while the latter five measure *realistic* fears
- Mason, O. J., Stevenson, C., & Freedman, F. (2014)

### Anxiety as a Barrier to Information Processing in the Event of a Cyberattack

![alt text](emotions_around_cyber-attack_scale.jpg)
- Following exposure to a visual news story about a cyber-attack, participants took these modified pre-existing inventories to measure their levels of anxiety, anger, and fear around the presented information
- Cheung‐Blunden, V., & Ju, J. (2016)

### Assessing Users’ Privacy and Security Concerns of Smart Home Technologies

![alt text](privacy_&_security_concerns_of_smart_home_tech_scale.jpg)
- Types of cybersecurity attack concerns (attack-unrelated, attack-related devices, attack-related data) were categorized by the themes that arose most prevalent in interviews, with quote examples of how these themes were extracted/coded
- Zimmermann, V., Gerber, P., Marky, K., Böck, L., & Kirchbuchner, F. (2019)

### Emotional Experiences of Cybersecurity Breach Victims

![alt text](emotions_following_cyber-security_breach_scale.jpg)
- Scale measuring participants' reflection of a prior experienced cybersecurity breach in terms of the "appraisals, action tendencies, bodily reactions, expressions, subjective feelings, and regulation attempts" that occured
- Budimir, S., Fontaine, J. R., & Roesch, E. B. (2021)

### Self-report feelings of anxiety and self-efficacy when using computers
Title: **Computer Self-Efficacy and Anxiety Scales for an Internet Sample: Testing Measurement Equivalence of Existing Measures and Development of New Scales**

![alt text](computer_self_efficacy_&_anxiety_scale.jpg)
- Sixteen items centered around self-report feelings of anxiety and self-efficacy when using computers
-  Barbeite, F. G., & Weiss, E. M. (2004)

### Artificial intelligence anxiety scale
Title: **Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Scale: an Initial Application in Predicting Motivated Learning Behavior**

![alt text](AI_anxiety_scale.jpg)
- Instrument measuring anxiety around AI (with some potentially concerning conflation of anxiety and fear-related vocabulary)
- Wang, Y. Y., & Wang, Y. S. (2022)
