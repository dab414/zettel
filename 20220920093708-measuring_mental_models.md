A significant challenge involved in understanding how mental models
[[20220919145732-mental_models.md]] influence perception and behavior is
measuring the mental model that's active in one's mind at any given time (rips,
1986, 1994; bonatti, 1998; o'brien et al., 1998).

There's also the concern that measuring one's mental model may alter that
mental model (Payne, 1991).

Methods for measuring mental models:

* Qualitative:
    * Scenario-based interviews and open ended questions (wash, 2010; krombholz et al., 2019; das et al., 2020; zimmerman et al., 2018; Bravo-lillo et al., 2011; kang et al., 2015; payne, 1991)
    * Sketching a diagram and / or think-aloud (Kang et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2017;
        Zimmerman et al., 2018)
	* Focus group (kwasny, 2008)
* Quantitative:
    * Card sorting (shirehjini et al., 2016; jeong, 2020; asgharpour et al., 2007)
	* Reaction time (cooke, 1994; blomacher et al., 2020)

Zimmerman et al (2018) use an open-ended sketching technique (along with think aloud) to
assess mental models. As such, participants yield highly variable sketches:
