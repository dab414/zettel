Smart cars are alarmingly insecure ([[20221014163027-smart_car_system_security_measures]]), lacking well-defined security measures for malicious parties attempting to gain access to a vehicle's network. Worringly, smart car users only have a few apparent options when it comes to protecting themselves against malevolent hackers. However, engaging with these options may go a long way in preserving their safety.

For example[1], [2], users may:
- Change the password for certain applications available on smart cars or on phones that interface with smart cars, like ones that involve GPS tracking, making it more difficult to guess.
- Update a vehicle's software whenever possible.
- Keep an eye out for abnormalities in the driving experience (e.g. a car driving in an unintended direction).
- Turn off apps that use GPS/location data when they aren't necessary, to prevent threats like GPS spoofing (often done to override a user's original destination input).
- Turn off Bluetooth if it isn't being used (see examples of cyber threats: [[20221014112036-smart_car_vulnerability]])
- Keep key fobs in a shielded/signal blocking puch to prevent relay attacks that could potentially copy the key's signal (see examples of physical threats: [[20221014112036-smart_car_vulnerability]])
	- In the case of a successful key fob relay attack, a practical defense is using an anti-theft steering wheel lock.
