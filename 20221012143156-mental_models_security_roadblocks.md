What are some of the factors that keep people from engaging in 'best-practice'
security measures. I'm going to primarily focus on *cyber security* here, and
how mental models ([[20220919145732-mental_models.md]]) might
contribute to security attitudes and behavior, but I'm open to considering
security practices more broadly across other systems. 

Overlaps a bit with general sources of human-caused security vulnerabilities in cyber
physical systems (see [[20220920111058-human_security_concerns_causes_CPS.md]]). And more
generally for a map of content for security issues related to cyber physical systems
(CPS), see [[20220920101902-human_security_CPS.md]].

One reason why people justify not understanding and acting upon security concerns in the
cyber (general) realm is because they offload responsibility to third parties (see
[[20221012103914-mental_models_security_offloading.md]].

In the general cyber realm, there is some debate as to why, despite the fact
that users receive good information about how to maintain good security
practices, users neglect to follow this advice. One idea is that users can't
understand the advice, and more education would solve the problem. Another
perspective claims that users are not capable of consistently making good
security decisions (Cranor, 2008). But these ideas don't explain why users
adhere to some practices but not others (discussion taken from Wash, 2010).

To develop: go through the qualitative results in Wash (2010) and pull out
other justifications people give for not adhering to best security practices.
