This is an overview of some of the human-centric concerns that affect the
[[20220919134650-manufacturing.md]] industry broadly. 

There are two general actors in a manufacturing pipeline:

* Designer
* Machine operator

Security concerns can arise if these actors are either (i) malicious or (ii) negligent. 

A third type of human vulnerability is an outside attacker. This attacker would clearly
have malicious intent (ie, not negligent), and could cause harm by (eg) spoofing data
signals between other actors in the network.

**Operator safety.** Operators typically have to undergo training / certification for how
to use the machinary (to prevent negligence). Ganesh mentioned it could be useful for
operators to also undergo psychological screening, perhaps before every shift. This is not
currently being implemented in practice---Ganesh says there's currently little to no
consideration of human processes in the safety of these systems.
