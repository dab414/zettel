What are some of the causes for security concerns that arise from humans, particularly in the
context of cyber-physical systems?

Two main factors are *intention* and *attention* (largely sourced from Ceesay et al., 2018):

* *Intention*
    * Ill intent
        * Actor is an insider
            * Could cause significant harm depending on:
                * Level of access in the system
                * Skill level
                * Maliciousness of intent
                * (these are mostly my ideas, need more soures here)
        * Actor is an outsider
            * Level of harm will depend on characteristics of attacker (see [[20220919093308-relevant_characteristics_of_an_attacker.md]].
            * What other factors? (need more here)
    * Excessive arrogance
        * Willfully ignorant of rules and procedures
        * Following curiosity without regard for safety
    * Excessive rule following (sort of my idea)
        * Blindly following procedure even if it violates common sense

* *Attention*
    * Assuming good intentions, security concerns can arise if one is negligent
    or distracted.
