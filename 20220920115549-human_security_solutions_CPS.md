What are ways to bolster security in a cyber physical system (CPS) from a human-centered
perspective?

* Information-centered approach (also referred to as "awareness training"; ceesay et al., 2018)
    * Give people information about security risks and they will avoid creating security
        risks
        * Can include phishing awareness (used by US Govt and defense contractors)
