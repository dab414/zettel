After identifying vulnerabilities in cyber physical systems (CPS) that arise
due to human causes [[20220920102600-human_security_vulnerabilities_CPS]] and
understanding the behaviors that cause these vulnerabilities to arise
[[20220920111058-human_security_vulnerability_causes_CPS]], we now explore ways
in which humans can act (either with or without external
influence/intervention) to mitigate the CPS security vulnerabilities.


A general framework for understanding the conditions under which people will
adopt more vigilant security practices ([2, 3, 4]).
	* Receive correct information about threats and risks
	* Accept that the information is correct and relevant
	* Understand how they ought to respond
	* Weight costs / benefits of responding against other options
		* This is me adding just a bit here
	* Decide to respond


Think about changing the framing below. I'm just thinking about this like you
can either initiaite some type of program or intervention to get people to
adopt more vigilant security practices, but sometimes they do so for other
reasons, such as a sudden increase in concern or threat perception. Not sure
how to best frame that.


## Causes that naturally lead humans to mitigate security vulnerabilities

This section is meant to capture causes that lead people to adopt more
vigilant security practices. We're putting specific emphasis on **concern or
anxiety about security** in the context of developing a scale of security
concern ([[20221020144236-security_concern_scale_cyber_physical_systems]]). 






## Mitigating human-caused vulnerabilities through outside influence / intervention

What are ways to bolster security in a cyber physical system (CPS) from a human-centered
perspective?

* Information-centered approach (also referred to as "awareness training"; ceesay et al., 2018)
    * Give people information about security risks and they will avoid creating security
        risks
        * Can include phishing awareness (used by US Govt and defense contractors)
