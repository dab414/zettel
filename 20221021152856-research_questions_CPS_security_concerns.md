This is an outline / brainstorming space for research questions related to
what will influence or be influenced by people's security concerns around
cyber physical systems (CPS). We are developing a scale to measure people's
security concerns around CPS (see
[[20221020144236-security_concern_scale_cyber_physical_systems.md]]), and we
want to simultaneously develop research questions that we can design
experiments around once this scale is ready to use. 

## Unstructured brainstorming space

* Can we look at how differences in people's mental models of CPS influence their security concerns?
* How might the sophistication of technology influence people's security concerns?
	* Thinking about Rick's example of how hackers exploited the wifi system of a goldfish tank to infiltrate a casino.
	* Do people assume that trivial technology is safe because it's not a worthy target?

... your ideas here!

## Some important constructs

**Some constructs**

These are other constructs that seem highly related to security concerns. I'm
guessing we can generate hypotheses about the relationships between these
constructs and security concerns.

* Consequences
    * What are the perceived consequences of a security breach?
* Agency
    * In what ways does the individual perceive that their actions will
        influence the likelihood of a security breach?
* Responsibility
    * Perceived responsibility of a security breach.
    * Same thing as blame?
* Likelihood of security breach
    * Perceived likelihood that CPS security will be breached generally.
    * Perceived likelihood that CPS security will be breached personally.
        * ie, that it will happen to "me".

**Interesting independent variables**

* Individual / collective
    * Does security concern vary in interesting ways depending on whether the
        risk is characterized more at an individual level (eg, a personal
        smart car) vs. a collective level (eg, a communal smart train).
* Familiarity
    * Does the extent to which one has familiarity with a type of system or
        technology predict their level of concern? 
    * For example, might people have different intuitions about security risks
        for smart cars vs. the electric grid because of greater familiarity with cars
        generally than with the mechanisms of smart grid
        operation?
* Priming
    * Will people's security concerns differ depending on which aspects of the
        CPS are highlighted or primed?
    * For example, when soliciting security concerns about smart cars, people
        could first be cued with information either about computers (to make
        salient the technology component of the smart car) or about cars
        generally (to make salient the automobile component of the smart car).

**Possible covariates**

What are important characteristics of individuals that we'd want to understand
or control for when thinking about people's intuitions about CPS security
concerns? Possibilities include:

* Current security practices
    * Is the individual vigilant in their security practices generally? Will
        security intuitions in one domain (eg, cyber security) be more likely
        to transfer to CPS than other domains (eg, general physical safety)?
    * See [[20220919144842-mental_model_analogies_cyber_security.md]] for a
        discussion of possible analogies that people use to understand risks
        around cyber systems.
* Usage of the technology
    * Does the extent to which a person uses the CPS influence their
        intuitions of its security? 
    * Related to familiarity. All those who use the technology should be
        familiar with it, but not necessarily vice versa.
