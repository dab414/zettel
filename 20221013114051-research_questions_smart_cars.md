There seems to be a gulf between the security vulnerabilities of smart cars
and people's understanding of smart car security.[^1] 

## Premises

We need to gather more information around the following premises to build
questions / arguments in this space:

1. Smart cars are vulnerable to attacks ([[20221014112036-smart_car_vulnerability]]).  
    * This is based off our conversation with Rick (ref
    `2022-10-13_daniel_nick.txt`). Can we find more support for this point from
    literature / technical sources?

    * Most modern vehicles are default unencrypted (need empirical support for
        this). Implies an attacker with physical access to a car could
        infiltrate provided enough skill and time with the car.

    * Possible sources of vulnerabilities might include updating software on
    the car itself, the connection between one's phone and the car, probably
    more. Maybe something having to do with attackers exploiting the often
    awkward interface between the driver and the car?

2. Attacks on smart cars can pose substantial threats to society. 
    * We need to determine what level of control attackers can gain if they
        hack into a smart car and how many cars they might be able to access
        at once. If the level of control is sufficiently high,
        and attackers are able to access a sufficiently high number of
        vehicles simultaneously, I'd argue that the substantiality of threat
        is self evident. 

3. Attacks on smart cars can be prevented by vigilent security practices on
   the part of the user.
    * What are some realistic actions users could take to bolster the security
        of their smart car? [[20221014151848-smart_cars_and_user_protection]]
        * Eg, is there such a thing as anti-virus software for smart cars?


## Research Questions / Hypotheses

1. People are unaware of the security risks surrounding smart cars.
    * This is based on my own (somewhat strong) intuition. Maybe we can find
        existing support for this point, but this might be an aspect we test
        for directly with survey work.

2. Even if people knew about these risks they would be unlikely to alter their
   behavior.
    * This is largely supported by observing people's attitudes and behaviors
        in the realm of cyber security (see
        [[20221012143156-mental_models_security_roadblocks.md]]), where people
        are largely reluctant to follow the advice of security experts in (eg)
        installing anti-virus software.

3. How can these risks be communicated to motivate people to make smarter
   security decisions with respect to their smart car?

       * Can involve education (ie, updating users' mental models) or crafting
           risk communication messages to be compatible with existing mental
           models. Researchers suggest the latter is easier (see
           [[20221007113848-mental_models_cyber_security_philosophy.md]]).

### Other interesting points

1. (more broadly) With the emergence of smarter, interconnected technology
   made for non-expert end users comes an increasing burden of responsibility
   on the users to be knowledgeable and vigilant about security threats. Most
   people who adopt new technology won't be aware of / won't internalize that
   responsibility.
