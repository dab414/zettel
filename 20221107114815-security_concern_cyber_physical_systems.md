This document goes over topics around security concern largely for the purpose of developing the security concern scale (see [[20221020144236-security_concern_scale_cyber_physical_systems]]).

**Definition of cyber physical security concern**

A heightened state of anxiety about security vulnerabilities in a cyber
physical system that might lead to the following types of harm:

* Physical 
* Financial
* Data / privacy
* Property
* Psychological

For a definition of security, see [[20221208104017-CPS_security]].

**Decomposing conern**
* *Does concern also include fear?*
	* Fear and anxiety are highly related but distinct (see
	[[20221107110053-distinguishing_between_fear_and_anxiety.md]]) and have
	different implications for security behaviors (see
	[[20221107101019-impacts_of_anxiety_fear_on_security.md]]).


**What is security concern not?**

We need to carefully distinguish that which we want to measure (CPS security concern) from other factors that should predict or be predicted by concern.

For example:

* It's not knowledge
	* I can have accurate knowledge and not be concerned
	* That includes knowledge of the system and / or knowledge of the risk itself
* It's not willingness to adopt the technology or take security measures
	* These are things concern should predict
