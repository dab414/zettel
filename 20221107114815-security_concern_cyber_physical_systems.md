**Definition of cyber physical security concern**

A heightened state of anxiety about security vulnerabilities in a cyber
physical system that might lead to the following types of harm:

* Physical / personal
* Financial
* Data / privacy
* Property


**Open questions**

* *Does concern also include fear?*
	* Fear and anxiety are highly related but distinct (see
	[[20221107110053-distinguishing_between_fear_and_anxiety.md]]) and have
	different implications for security behaviors (see
	[[20221107101019-impacts_of_anxiety_fear_on_security.md]]).

* *We need to hit the right level of generalizability / specificity.* 
	* For example, a general measurement of anxiety isn't unique, but developing a
	measure that's only valid for one specific CPS doesn't have general value.


**What is security concern not?**

We need to carefully distinguish that which we want to measure (CPS security concern) from other factors that should predict or be predicted by concern.

For example:

* It's not knowledge
	* I can have accurate knowledge and not be concerned
	* That includes knowledge of the system and / or knowledge of the risk itself
* It's not willingness to adopt the technology or take security measures
	* These are things concern should predict
