The basic idea behind the actor-network theory (ANT) is that both humans and non-humans
have agency and will influence a system. These agents are inseperable and their
relationship should be considered as a foundational part of the system. It's a theoretical
framework for appreciating both the system as a whole and the contributions of the
individual parts.

**Terminology:**
- *Actors*: parts of the system
- *Translation*: the way in which the parts of the system work together
- *Network*: the end product, the system as a whole
- *Punctualization*: the tendency to perceive the system only as a whole rather than a
collection of parts

The scope of each of these can be difficult to define. Such definitions should be given
much thought and should probably be done by the experts of the system.

The above largely comes from (sreeramagiri et al., 2022). These authors give an example of
a car being a network. People tend to punctualize the car (ie, see it as one *thing*)
until the car breaks down, at which point the reality that the network is made up of many
parts becomes obvious.
