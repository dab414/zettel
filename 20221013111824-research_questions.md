Mapping out developing research questions in different areas of HCPS.

A prerequisite for coming up with research questions will be deciding on a
cyber physical system (CPS) to begin the inquiry with.[^1] See [[link to
finding a starting CPS]].

[^1]: There's always the potential of drafting research questions that
  generalize across CPSs, but I think it'd be much more effective to target
  one specific system, at least at the beginning (2022-10-13).

Once we have a CPS to start with, the general approach for building research
questions in this space will be to (i) understand how people currently
understand the system (ie, their mental model of the system) specifically as
it relates to the security of the system, and (ii) research how we might
intervene on human processes so as to bolster security. 

Note how two possible approaches to (ii) could be to either adjust
communication of risks to be more compatible with a person's existing mental
model, or try to alter a person's mental
model to be more accurate (see [[20221010104214-optimizing_mental_models.md]]
and [[20221007113848-mental_models_cyber_security_philosophy.md]]).
