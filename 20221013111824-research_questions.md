Mapping out developing research questions or directions in different areas of HCPS.

## Investigating generally across cyber physical systems

* Develop a survey scale assessing lay people's security concerns of cyber physical
    systems (see [[20221020144236-security_concern_scale_cyber_physical_systems]]).

* Develop research questions around what will influence or be influenced by people's security concerns of cyber physical systems (see [[20221021152856-research_questions_CPS_security_concerns]]).

## Investigating a specific cyber physical system

See concerns surrounding finding candidate CPS's for closer inquiry: [[20221019145808-needed_features_for_cyber_physical_system.md]].

Once we have a CPS to start with, the general approach for building research
questions in this space will be to: 

* understand how people currently understand the system (ie, their mental model of the system) specifically as it relates to the security of the system, and 
* research how we might intervene on human processes so as to bolster security. 

Note how two possible approaches to (ii) could be to either adjust
communication of risks to be more compatible with a person's existing mental
model, or try to alter a person's mental
model to be more accurate (see [[20221010104214-optimizing_mental_models.md]]
and [[20221007113848-mental_models_cyber_security_philosophy.md]]).
