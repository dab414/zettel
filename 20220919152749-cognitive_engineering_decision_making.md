Agents in a cyber physical system (CPS) can be thought of as having mental models (see
[[20220919145732-mental_models.md]]; burns et al., 2018), whether they are human or not.
These agents often will need to make fast decisions based on these models, which opens the
door for errors with potentially high costs.

For non-humans, there is pressure on developers to brainstorm all possible edge cases.
Burns et al. (2018) give the example of a smart scooter in a CPS that suddenly shorts out,
and sensors on a nearby vehicle aren't equipped to handle that scenario. 


Considering all actors in the CPS to have mental models that work together is a similar
framework to the actor-network theory (ANT; see
[[20220919113949-actor_network_theory_ANT.md]].
