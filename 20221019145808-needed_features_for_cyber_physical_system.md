There are several features we would like for a cyber physical system to have in order for
it to be considered in our HCPS inquiry. These features principally center on interactions
between the human and the system.

* A role for human decision making in the system
* A way in which the role of human decision making might directly affect the vulnerability
    of the system
* There are things people can do proactively to bolster security of the system

**Optimize for:**

* Likelihood of attack in the event of poor human decision making
* Magnitude of harm in the event of an attack

Higher on the above two factors raises the value of research into the domain.
