Cyber threats come in many forms across many systems, with a multitude of motivations and incentives for hackers to target a particular person or persons. Some of these attacks can results in financial loss on persons and business when important data/access is made available to malicious parties. Below are a number of examples across the domains of computers/smart phone, planes, energy, and bionic limbs.

## Financial:
- Computers/smart phones:
	- Phishing emails with malware or dangerous links attached
		- One common type of malware is ransomware, which may prevent a user's access to their computer until they give the hacker money
	- Near-field communication (NFC) sensors (which are often used to pay for items by placing a phone next to a reader, with a detectable range of about 4 inches) may be misused by nearby hackers who use it to steal financial and other information
		- NFC can be disabled when not in use
- Planes:
	- Hackers gaining access to plane systems that communicate wirelessly to reduce flight delays/idle emissions. This can cost time, money, and give away sensitive information to unauhtorized parties [4]
- Energy:
	- Smart meters can be hacked and their parameters changed to lead to house fires/explosions. Additionally, since they link to the larger energy grid, a blackout can be caused and lead to downstream property damage and financial consequences as energy is not supplied to necessary facilities [1]
		- Hackers may also use this access to change how much a homeowner is paying for energy or siphon energy [2], [3]
- Bionic Limbs:
	- Some bionic limbs have smart capabilities, like displays, near-field communication ability, activity tracking, and bluetooth connectivity. This may allow hackers to steal personal information from the devices [5]
