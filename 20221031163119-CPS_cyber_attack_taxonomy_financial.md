Cyber threats come in many forms across many systems, with a multitude of motivations and incentives for hackers to target a particular person or persons. Some of these attacks can result in financial loss on persons and business when important data/access is made available to malicious parties. Below are a number of examples across the domains of computers/smart phone, planes, energy, and bionic limbs.

The financial costs recorded in the past due to both malicious attackers and defensive strategies are astronomical: [[202212071713-CPS_financial_costs]]

## Financial:
- Computers/smart phones:
	- Phishing emails with malware or dangerous links attached
		- Phishing emails may be used to attain passwords, credentials, or credit card/banking information from a target. These can also happen via text or call.
		- Related: credit card scams, e-banking scams [7]
	- Near-field communication (NFC) sensors (which are often used to pay for items by placing a phone next to a reader, with a detectable range of about 4 inches) may be misused by nearby hackers who use it to steal financial and other information
		- NFC can be disabled when not in use
	- Evil-maid attacks: targeting devices left unattended/shut-down. Most of the time such attacks are carried out by internal corporate staff or an espionage attacker. Boot loaders or USB drives may be plugged into the unattended device to install a key logger that captures encryption keys to then steal data [6]
	- Ransomware attacks: software that targets a system's functionality by locking the data and sending a ransom message to the system owner that they will not unlock the system until a specified amount of money is paid. [6]
- Smart Meters:
	- Businesses may be hurt by motivated attacks that want to reduce utility/tarrif bills by hacking smart utility systems and injecting bad data [6]
- Planes:
	- Hackers gaining access to plane systems that communicate wirelessly to reduce flight delays/idle emissions. This can cost time, money, and give away sensitive information to unauhtorized parties [4]
- Energy:
	- Smart meters can be hacked and their parameters changed to lead to house fires/explosions. Additionally, since they link to the larger energy grid, a blackout can be caused and lead to downstream property damage and financial consequences as energy is not supplied to necessary facilities [1]
		- Hackers may also use this access to change how much a homeowner is paying for energy or siphon energy [2], [3]
- Bionic Limbs:
	- Some bionic limbs have smart capabilities, like displays, near-field communication ability, activity tracking, and bluetooth connectivity. This may allow hackers to steal personal information from the devices [5]
