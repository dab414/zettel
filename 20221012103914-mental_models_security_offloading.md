When it comes to people's mental models of cyber security (see
[[20221010113520-mental_models_and_security.md]]), people (ie, home users) tend
to offload the responsibility for security to other parties, such as companies
or governments.  Evidence comes from how employees handle security issues
(Dourish et al., 2004), what knowledge end users have at large organizations
(Gross & Rossum, 2007), and how home network users think about network
administration practices (Grinter et al., 2005). More generally, people "exert
much effort to avoid security decisions." (Wash, 2010, p. 2).

What's interesting to me is the determining factors underlying people's
tendencies to avoid making security decisions. Intuitively, I think people
might believe that they either (i) wouldn't be able to acquire the needed
knowledge to make informed decisions (ie, it requires a level of expertise
beyond that which they're capable of teaching themselves), or (ii) that the
effort associated with learning the needed knowledge is too great, and that
engaging in efforts to avoid or offload is actually the cognitively easier
course of action. This, of course, frames the problem in terms of effort demand
avoidance (see [[20221012105222-effort_demand_avoidance.md]].
