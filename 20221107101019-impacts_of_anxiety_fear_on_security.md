Fear and anxiety are highly overlapping constructs (see
[[20221107110053-distinguishing_between_fear_and_anxiety.md]]), but past research
suggests, in the context of cyber security, the distinction is important.

**Fear** has been shown to lead to avoidance with respect to technology (Cheung-Blundin et
al., 2019). Those higher in state or trait fear are more likely to engage in avoidance
behaviors such as canceling credit cards and avoiding online banking (Cheung-Blundin et
al., 2019; see the surveys used to measure avoidance at
[[20221103134931-scales_measuring_cyber_security_concern.md]] under heading "Surveillance,
vigilance, and avoidance security measures).

The relationship between **anxiety** and security behavior has been shown to be more
complex. Some evidence to suggest that anxiety leads to approach behavior, although
evidence is not as strong as for fear (Cheung-Blundin et al., 2019; Perkins & Corr, 2006;
Perkins et al., 2010). Some have argued that anxiety can be facilitating (improving performance)
or debilitating (worsening performance; Alpert & Haber, 1960). One hypothesis is that anxiety
is debilitating for complex tasks and, since IT is complex, anxiety tends to worsen performance
in the realm of IT (Wang & Wang, 2022).
