How do people understand technology and the security risks that are associated with it?

Assuming people are unfamiliar with technology, they might understand it by drawing on
analogies to their [[20220919145732-mental_models.md]] with more familiar systems (camp,
2006).

Analogous mental models include (camp, 2006):

* medical
* theft
* physical
* warfare
* markets / economic failure

There are two main perspectives on how drawing analogies to mental models outside a domain
might impact understanding of the mental model within that domain:

* *strong intervention*: analogous mental models will *improve* understanding.
* *weak intervention*: analogous mental models will *alter* understanding.

Brase and colleagues (2017) tested between these two views by having Ps perform Bayesian
reasoning tasks where they were asked to assess risk in various domains, including cyber
security. They found evidence *against* the strong intervention, as being presented with
analogous domains did not always improve performance. They found mixed support in favor of
the weak intervention view, and overall it seemed as though mental model analogies
mattered little for reasoning about risk in the cyber security domain.
