Within the domain of manufacturing, a cyber attack can result in negative outcomes that
can have a cascading effect (see [[20220919100750-forward_feeding_attack]]. These outcomes are:

* breach of physical privacy
* unauthorized actuation
* incorrect actuation
* delayed actuation
* prevented actuation

*actuation*: causing a machine to operate.

The list above comes from sreeramagiri et al., 2022.

Sreeramagiri et al. claim that the last three are the most problematic and give the
example of a cyber attack in a manufacturing pipeline for Honda. An attack can cause
faulty parts to be created (incorrect actuation), which can cause the factory to shut down
to address the issue, leading to delays and an inability to produce.
