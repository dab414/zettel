As the sophistication of smart cars increases, the number of systems ([[20221014163216-cyber-physical_system_catalogue_smart_cars]]) necessary to keep the car running as intended likewise grows. Unfortunately, disadvantages are coupled with all of the benefits of this complexity as many of the systems in smart vehicles are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Perhaps more distressing, these systems are often relatively insecure ([[20221014163027-smart_car_system_security_measures]]) and users have little power in defending against attacks ([[20221014151848-smart_cars_and_user_protection]]).

Cyber attacks on vehicles can come in a number of forms, with researchers[1] dividing these up into three types: cyber attacks, cyber-physical attacks, and physical attacks. Each one encompasses a range of distinct methods and consequences. Below are definitions and a few examples.

* Cyber: Components with computation and communication ability, with ***no*** direct link to physical components in the vehicle.
	* Ex. Accessing a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) communication log to identify a vehicle's ID. [1]
	* Ex. Accessing a car's Bluetooth system may allow for the injection of malware into other components of the car, such as the engine control unit (ECU). [1]
* Cyber-Physical: Components with computation and communication ability, with links to physical components in the vehicle.
	* Ex. The on-board diagnostics (OBD) port vehicles are equipped with is usually used for mechanics/repair technicians to assess issues with your car (e.g., issues that would coincide with an engine light appearing). These ports also allow for  communication with the vehicle's computer, which may allow a hacker to inject malware into the computer. [3] Even worse, a car with this malware may be able to pass it onto the diagnostic tool a mechanic might use to assess the vehicle, and cause the virus to spread. [5]
	* Ex. Hackers may exploit a car alarm system's insecure direct object reference (IDORS) to "***track the vehicle’s GPS location, disable the alarm, unlock doors, and in some cases even kill the engine while it is being used.***" [3]
	* Ex. A car's controller area network (CAN)[[]] allows communication between the various systems present in a car, such as airbags, brakes, power windows, and windshield wipers. Cyber threats known as replay attacks allow hackers who have access to a vehicle's CAN system to repeat commands that were done in the vehicle previously, such as re-engaging window or brake systems, with varying consequences. [1]
* Physical: Physical components that link with other physical components for purposes of moderation or control
	* Ex. Tesla's pedestrian warning system, which triggers an alarming noise when the user is driving under ~19mph. This system is used to minimize safety concerns over the quiet operation of electric vehicles when driving in pedestrian-rich areas. If comprimised, little to no warning about the vehicle's presence would be available for pedestrians nearby. This could be an issue especially if the driver is irresponsible. [4]
	* Ex. Thermometers in vehicles could be tampered with if temperature sensors would subjected to extreme cold or heat. [1]
	* Ex. Relay attacks on key fobs using radio-frequency identification (RFID) [[]] allow hackers to copy the electronic signal used to interact with a car's door lock and later enter and start the vehicle themselves. [3]
