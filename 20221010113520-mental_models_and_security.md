mental models in security 

Volkamer and Renaud's (2013) review of this topic suggests that researchers
have basically approached this through interview methods, asking people their
intuitions on the nature of security and threats, and then categorizing
different types of understandings.

Camp (2006) did a literature review to categorize different types of mental
models for security (see also [[20220919144842-mental_model_analogies_cyber_security.md]]):

* Physical security model
* Medical model
* Criminal model
* Warfare model
* Market model

Models were later validated empirically via interviews and card sorting (Liu et
al., 2008).

For a review of research looking at assessing people's mental models for various aspects of cyber security, see Volkamer and Renaud (2013; p. 11 / 265). 

Some highlights from this ^ discussion. People believe they're mostly safe from
attacks because of beliefs around how such vulnerabilities arise (eg, visiting
'bad' websites) or due to attackers being more interested in other targets
(Wash, 2010). People rely on different cues to assess whether a website is
trustworthy---people will offload security concerns to trustworthy companies
(eg, when interacting with a Google or Apple platform; Friedman et al., 2002).
