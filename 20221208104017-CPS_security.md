A map of content for all things related to the security of cyber physical
systems (CPS).

## Security Definition

Security as I've come to think of it in the context of cyber physical systems is a multifaceted construct involving four main aspects:

* Aspects of the cyber physical system
	* Particularly vulnerabilities that can be exploited
* Aspects of the attacker
	* Including skills, motivation, affiliation, etc. (see [[20220919093308-relevant_characteristics_of_an_attacker]])
* The relationship between the system vulnerabilities and attacker (ie, attacks)
	* eg, denial of service, etc.; see [[20221208104845-CPS_cyber_attack_types]]
* Aspects of the outcome that would be caused by a successful attack
	* Nature of the outcome can vary along several dimensions:
		* An 'expected value' of the harm:
			* How harmful / severe is the outcome?
			* How likely is the outcome to be realized? (depends on first two aspects of security)
		* Different types of harm (see [[20221020134323-CPS_cyber_attack_harm_taxonomy]])
			* Physical
			* Financial
			* Privacy
			* Property
			* Psychological


The things I've outlined here seem to overlap with how high-level concepts are described / defined in [1].

For specific consideration of the human role in CPS security, see [[20220920101902-human_security_CPS.md]].
