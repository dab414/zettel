There is a lack of research specifically focusing on how cyber attacks may target and exploit human cognition.

For example, one target of an attack could be to cause impaired decision making or
frustration by introducing pop ups or system lag. This would be an example of a feed-forward attack (see [[20220919100750-forward_feeding_attack.md]]).

The US Joint Staff defined five specific categories of an attack designed to impair decision making:

* degrade 
* deceive
* deny
* destroy
* disrupt

    the goal of an attack can be to negatively impact decision making
