Here we are documenting some of the psychological types of harm that can come
as a result of an attack on a cyber physical system.

* (simulated) Attacks on cyber security associated with increased cortisol levels and
    ratings of insecurity [1]. 
* Feelings of emotional intensity can arise from a cyber attack (specifically, accessing one's web camera) [2].
	* Eg, panic, fear, worry, upset, discomfort, anger
	* Also the need to find a solution, stop the threat, regain control.
	* Also betrayal of trust and restlessness

* found some great resources and definitions in [3]
	* under their cyber-harm type "psychological":
