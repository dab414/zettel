## Broad goal

We want to develop a general survey scale that can assess the extent to which
a lay person is concerned about the security of a cyber physical system. This
scale should be able to be applied generally across different cyber physical
systems, such that asking the same questions in regards to different systems
will give a measurement of concern for each system.

## Approach

The general approach to developing a scale of security concern for cyber
physical systems will be the following: (i) assess what's been done in past
research, (ii) identify the important constructs that will make up the
measurement of "security concern", (iii) develop survey questions that will
reveal each of those constructs, and (iv) collect data to validate the
connection between the questions and their intended constructs, as well as
validating that our measurement of security concern predicts other constructs
in ways that would be expected (eg, negatively predict willingness to adopt
the technology). See below for more detail on each point.


### Gather previous research

In progress. We want past research dealing with:

* Scales for measuring security concerns in other domains
	* [[20221103134931-scales_measuring_cyber_security_concern]]
* People's intuitions about what security best practices are
    * We're especially interested in their *wrong* intuitions
    * Could pilot test for this point if there's not much previous research
        * See [[20220919144842-mental_model_analogies_cyber_security.md]] for
            discussion of people's understanding of technology and the
            security risks associated with it.

### Establish working definition of "security concern"

A heightened state of anxiety about security vulnerabilities in a cyber
physical system that might lead to the four types of harm defined below.

See [[20221107114815-security_concern_cyber_physical_systems.md]] for more on the definition.

### Identify important constructs

**Core constructs**

We want to get a sense of people's concern over the security of cyber physical systems along the following harm dimensions:

* Physical / personal
* Financial
* Data / privacy
* Property

For more detail on each of these types of harm, see [[20221020134323-CPS_cyber_attack_harm_taxonomy]].

### Develop survey items

Once we've covered past research and developed a final set of core constructs,
we will develop survey items specific to each core construct. For example, if
financial harm is a core construct, we will develop questions specifically
targeted at revealing people's concerns about financial harm.

See a draft of survey items [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PitA3aGj05_QwP6mBBUp9CAV8u9qaT7RaCRcC1OWbU/edit).

### Validate the scale

Once questions are developed, we will collect data and run statistical tests
designed to assess whether survey items cluster together in ways that we would
expect based on our organization of survey questions and core constructs.

Once question responses seem to be grouping in ways that we would expect, we
can test whether the scale of security concern predicts other factors that we
might expect it to. For example, we would expect security concerns to
negatively predict willingness to adopt the CPS into one's life.
