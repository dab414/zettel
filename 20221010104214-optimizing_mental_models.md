## Optimizing mental models

If the goal is to establish in someone a 'correct' mental model
([[20220919145732-mental_models.md]]), there are challenges that vary based on
the type of mental model that the person currently has.

* Someone is completely new to a topic. Need to introduce the topic in a way
that's compatible to the learner (no further detail; Willingham, 2009). 

* Someone has correct but partial understanding of a topic. Try to first
understand what the person knows (Conrad, 2008) and then build upon this
understanding in a way that links to preexisting knowledge (Taber, 2003).

* Someone has an incorrect understanding. This is the most challenging
situation, because incorrect mental models can be resistant to change and
be generalized inappropriately (Dekker & Hollnagel, 2004). They need to
unlearn concepts, it's not enough to just present new information
(Cegarra-Navarro et al., 2012; see also Bain, 2011).
