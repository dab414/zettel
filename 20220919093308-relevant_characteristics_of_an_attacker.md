#hcps #attacker 

Certain features of an attacker are thought to be relevant (mancuso et al., 2014):
* affiliation (kjaerland, 2005)
* classification (eg, hacker / spy; kjaerland, 2005)
* skill level (howard, 1997)
* level of maliciousness (meyers et al., 2009)

This information is considered to be part of the *source* of the attack (mancuso et al.,
2014).
