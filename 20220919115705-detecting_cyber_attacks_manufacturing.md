Detecting attacks in [[manufacturing]] can be difficult, especially if the attack results in
only subtle defects to the end product. The most devastating type of defect is the one
that isn't deteccted until the product is consumed by the end user (sreeramagiri et al., 2002).

Product defects as a result of errors or cyber attacks can be especially problematic if
the product is in a mass production line, as the defect will replicate potentially many
times.

Even if there is a defect, if it doesn't result in a failed product for some period after
the product has been used, the product might have already fulfilled its 'lifespan'. For
example, if an inherently defective screw is good for five years and then breaks, it's
unlikely that the defect will be detected.

Even if a defect is detected, tracing the defect back to its source is challenging (see 
[[20220919120128-tracing_defect_to_source_manufacturing.md]]).
