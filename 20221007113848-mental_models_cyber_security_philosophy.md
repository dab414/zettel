In the domain of cyber security, developers have tended to get frustrated with
users for not taking security warnings seriously. The response of this conflict
has led developers to regard users with distain, blaming security breaches on
users' ignorance [1]. However, recent perspectives in
cyber security have highlighed the need to consider not only the risk when
designing warning systems, but also users' mental models ([[20220919145732-mental_models.md]]) of the technology [2-4]. 

Researchers have argued that, in cyber security, user's mental models need to
include some concept of vulnerability to attacks. So communication needs to be
aligned with where users' mental models are at, but mental models need to be
adapted / extended to increase the chance that a user will recognize and
respond to threats / vulnerabilities (all comes from Volkamer & Renaud, 2013).

It's easier to align risk communication messages to a user's existing mental
model (even if that model is wrong), then to try to correct the mental model.
