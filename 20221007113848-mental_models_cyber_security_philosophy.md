In the domain of cyber security, developers have tended to get frustrated with
users for not taking security warnings seriously. The response of this conflict
has led developers to regard users with distain, blaming security breaches on
users' ignorance [1]. However, recent perspectives in
cyber security have highlighed the need to consider not only the risk when
designing warning systems, but also users' mental models ([[20220919145732-mental_models.md]]) of the technology [2-4].
