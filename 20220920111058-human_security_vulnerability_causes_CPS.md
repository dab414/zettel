This document focuses on understanding the problematic behaviors that give rise
to security vulnerabilities in CPSs. 

For a discussion on factors that contribute to the ceasing of these problematic
behviors and the adoption of more constructive behaviors, see
[[20220920115549-human_security_vulnerability_mitigation_CPS.md]].

## Attention and intention

Two main factors are *intention* and *attention* (largely sourced from Ceesay et al., 2018):

* *Intention*
    * Ill intent
        * Actor is an insider
            * Could cause significant harm depending on:
                * Level of access in the system
                * Skill level
                * Maliciousness of intent
                * (these are mostly my ideas, need more soures here)
        * Actor is an outsider
            * Level of harm will depend on characteristics of attacker (see [[20220919093308-relevant_characteristics_of_an_attacker.md]].
            * What other factors? (need more here)
    * Excessive arrogance
        * Willfully ignorant of rules and procedures
        * Following curiosity without regard for safety
    * Excessive rule following (sort of my idea)
        * Blindly following procedure even if it violates common sense

* *Attention*
    * Assuming good intentions, security concerns can arise if one is negligent
    or distracted.

## Other factors

* Motivation and ability [3]
	* Seems similar to intention and attention

* Harm severity
	* People won't care about security if they don't think they have anything
valuable to protect (Dynes et al., 2008)
	* Example: most people use computers just to browse and send emails. No
concern for security if there's no sensitive data.

* People don't adopt appropriate security practices because:
	* They don't perceive the risks
	* They do not know or fully understand the 'correct' behavior
	[3]

* They're averse to the amount of effort required
