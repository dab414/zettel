Below are a number of scales from previous research looking into various aspects of cyber concern. We tried to select scales that focused on the negative emotional aspects of concern, such as fear and anxiety.

## Concern and cyber security

### Assessing Users’ Privacy and Security Concerns of Smart Home Technologies

![alt text](privacy_&_security_concerns_of_smart_home_tech_scale.jpg)
- Types of cybersecurity attack concerns (attack-unrelated, attack-related devices, attack-related data) were categorized by the themes that arose most prevalent in interviews, with quote examples of how these themes were extracted/coded
- Zimmermann, V., Gerber, P., Marky, K., Böck, L., & Kirchbuchner, F. (2019)

### Emotional Experiences of Cybersecurity Breach Victims

![alt text](emotions_following_cyber-security_breach_scale.jpg)
- Scale measuring participants' reflection of a prior experienced cybersecurity breach in terms of the "appraisals, action tendencies, bodily reactions, expressions, subjective feelings, and regulation attempts" that occured
- Budimir, S., Fontaine, J. R., & Roesch, E. B. (2021)

### Surveillance, vigilance, and avoidance cybersecurity measures
**Title: Functional Divergence of Two Threat-Induced Emotions: Fear-Based Versus Anxiety-Based Cybersecurity Preferences**

![alt_text](cheung-blunden_et_al_2019.jpg)

* A 26 item scale measuring surveillance, vigilance, and avoidance in the context of specific actions one could take in the domain of cyber security.
* Cheung-Blunden et al., 2019.

### Incident anxiety scale
**Title: Trust in the smart home: Findings from a nationally representative survey in the UK**

* Items measuring 'incident anxiety':
	* I (would) fully trust smart home devices not to fail, and to function as I expect them to--(competence)
	* I think the likelihood of the security of smart home devices being compromised and resulting in a privacy/data breach is high
	* I think the likelihood of the security of smart home devices being compromised and resulting in an incident (eg, burglary, fraud) is high
	* I think the impact of the security of smart home devices being compromised and resulting in an incident (eg, burglary, fraud) is low

* These authors ran some big overall survey on smart homes and sort of serendipitously found a factor grouping of items that they called 'incident anxiety'
* Basically anxiety around a security breach emerging that will lead to phyiscal harm
* Cannizzaro et al., 2019


## General negative emotions

###  Scale distinguishing between fear, anxiety, and anger (generally)
**Title: Anxiety as a Barrier to Information Processing in the Event of a Cyberattack**

![alt text](emotions_around_cyber-attack_scale.jpg)
- Following exposure to a visual news story about a cyber-attack, participants took these modified pre-existing inventories to measure their levels of anxiety, anger, and fear around the presented information
- Cheung‐Blunden, V., & Ju, J. (2016)


###  State / trait anxiety scale
**Title: Development of the short version of the spielberger state—trait anxiety
inventory**

![alt_text](zsido_et_al_2020.jpg)

* Two scales measuring trait (below) / state (above) anxiety.
* Zsido et al., (2020)

## Concerns about technology generally

### Cyber-Paranoia and Fear Scale

**Title: Ever-present threats from information technology: the Cyber-Paranoia and Fear Scales**

![alt text](cyber_paranoia_fear_scale.jpg)
- The first six items here were written to measure *paranoid* fears around information technology, while the latter five measure *realistic* fears
- Mason, O. J., Stevenson, C., & Freedman, F. (2014)


### Self-report feelings of anxiety and self-efficacy when using computers
Title: **Computer Self-Efficacy and Anxiety Scales for an Internet Sample: Testing Measurement Equivalence of Existing Measures and Development of New Scales**

![alt text](computer_self_efficacy_&_anxiety_scale.jpg)
- Sixteen items centered around self-report feelings of anxiety and self-efficacy when using computers
-  Barbeite, F. G., & Weiss, E. M. (2004)

### Artificial intelligence anxiety scale
Title: **Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Scale: an Initial Application in Predicting Motivated Learning Behavior**

![alt text](AI_anxiety_scale.jpg)
- Instrument measuring anxiety around AI (with some potentially concerning conflation of anxiety and fear-related vocabulary)
- Wang, Y. Y., & Wang, Y. S. (2022)
