Are people concerned about companies collecting their data?

Some evidence suggests few people are concerned about excessive data
collection without consent, and even fewer people are concerned about
sharing data with third parties (Lee et al., 2019).

People are willing to share data if the sharing is under the pretense that the
data will be given to the manufacturer and help in efforts to improve the
platform. However, people are skeptical when internet service providers or
government agencies make such claims about needing data to improve platforms
(Zheng et al., 2018).
