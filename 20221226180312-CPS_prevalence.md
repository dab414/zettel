Many of the attacks outlined in the documents found within [[20221020134323-CPS_cyber_attack_harm_taxonomy]] are theoretical, or described due to a small number of legitimate security breaches occuring (e.g., infrastructural hacks). While these hacks, theoretical or otherwise, are still legitimate concerns to mull over and may become more prevalent in the future, the vast majority of them will not be on the security radar of the average person in the present. That is, they will not affect their day to day security thoughts or practices. 

However, there are a few devices and hacks that are important to mention here that are extremely prevalent, and likely will be more so in the future if security practices at the level of the individual are not modified.

One such device is the cellphone, which, according to the Pew Research Center (2021) [1], is used by about 97% of Americans. About 85% own cellphones that could be characterized as "smartphones", which was only about 35% of Americans in 2011. Similarly, about 75% of Americans own a desktop or laptop computer.

These devices are by far the most prevalent of those that can be defined as "cyber physical systems", with a slew of different hacks that can be mounted against them, with varying types (e.g., physical, financial, etc.) and levels of consequence.

Another CPS that is becoming more and more prevalent are medical devices. About 30% of US adults use wearable healthcare devices (e.g., ) that are rife with data [2]. 8% to 10% of the American population and about 5% to 6% of people in industrialized countries have implanted medical devices [3]. These devices being hacked may result in particularly dire consequences. See: [[20221031162928-CPS_cyber_attack_taxonomy_physical]]

A final point of interest for CPS prevalence is the growing rate of 5G adoption which is one technology drives the growth of IoT, and by extension CPSs. A report from Statista shows that "**G subscriptions are forecast to increase drastically worldwide from 2019 to 2027, from over 12 million to over 4 billion subscriptions**" [4]. This will also greatly affect connected vehicles, which are expected to become the "largest installed base of 5G IoT endpoints" by 2023.
