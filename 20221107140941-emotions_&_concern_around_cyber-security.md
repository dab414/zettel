Security and privacy concerns around IoT devices play a large role in people's decision to adopt them [1], as well as their behaviors toward them [2], [3],[4]. The emotions laced with specific concerns, whether they be rooted in fear or anxiety, are yet another dimension that determines the nature of a person's behavior when engaging with smart systems.

#### Fear
- Fear may be broken down into realistic fears and unrealistic (or paranoid) fears. This is a salient distinction in the study of cyber-security fears as the novelty and ambiguity of cyberspace lends itself to a wide range of these two types of fears.
- Fear manifests itself in "avoidant" behaviors. In the context of the internet and cybersecurity, fearful users may "avoid e-commerce, shun social media, [or] adopt air-gap defensive measures".

#### Anxiety
- While fear leads people to increase the distance between them and the perceived threat, anxiety closes that gap to survey the threat constantly
- Anxiety manifests itself in "monitoring" behaviors. In the context of the internet and cybersecurity, anxious users may be "hypervigilant, reassurance-seeking, [and] compulsively check [devices]".
