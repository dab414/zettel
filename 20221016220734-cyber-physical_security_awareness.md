Cyber-security is an extremely broad idea that might mean something slightly different to each and every person that is asked to define it. For example, one person might immediately conjure images of their desktop computer and the antivirus they have installed on it, or the password book they hold in a well-hidden area in their home. In any case, there are a great number of colloquialisms surrounding the idea of "cyber-security", and the greater culture surrounding technology. However, the world of technology continues to grow exponentially faster than the adoption of new commonsense models of cyber-security. As a result, a lack of awareness of the range and breadth of cyber vulnerabilities that are everpresent prevades.

One researcher [1] set out to examine exactly how lacking this awareness of cyber vulnerabilities is, by setting up various experiments that test both awareness of CPS vulnerability, and the ability to detect attacks as they take place on a system.
