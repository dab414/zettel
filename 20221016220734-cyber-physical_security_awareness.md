Cyber-security is an extremely broad idea that might mean something slightly different to each and every person that is asked to define it. For example, one person might immediately conjure images of their desktop computer and the antivirus they have installed on it, or the password book they hold in a well-hidden area in their home. In any case, there are a great number of colloquialisms surrounding the idea of "cyber-security", and the greater culture surrounding technology. However, the world of technology continues to grow exponentially faster than the adoption of new commonsense models of cyber-security. As a result, a lack of awareness of the range and breadth of cyber vulnerabilities that are everpresent prevades.

One researcher [1] set out to examine exactly how lacking cyber-security awareness is by setting up various experiments that test both awareness of vulnerability, and the ability to detect attacks as they happen on a system. These tests were done on undergraduate university students.

In the case of awareness, participants were found to be far less aware of the cyber-security vulnerabilities of smart phones and other devices compared to computers. Subjects were generally unaware that their laptops had light sensors and Near-Field Communication (NFC) capabilities. About a quarter were aware that smartphones had NFC and over 40% did not report that tablets they owned had motion sensors. Nearly a third weren't even aware that they could install anti-virus software on their smart phones.

In terms of awareness of specific attacks, participants overall were aware of data theft, network hacking, camera access, and sound recording. Attack types that >50% of participants were aware of include "network mapping, ransomware preventing access to cyber-physical systems, using NFC to steal financial information and using movement sensors to determine an individual's screen lock PIN".

In the case of an attack detection simulation where participants looked at webpages with questions on one computer screen while they looked at phishing emails on a second screen. After each task was completed, a new page would follow that had a questionnaire where participants could comment if they had seen anything amiss on the previous page and how confident they were that the anomaly (if reported) was a cyberattack.
- There were multiple kinds of attacks:
	-   Phishing emails
	-   Malicious pop ups asked participants to run a .exe file or a modal feedback pop-up (asking if participant would like to leave feedback on the website)
	-   Web cam attack (identify a webcam light being switched on)
	-   Mouse indicator (symbol in bottom left of screen  appeared when mouse was moved)
	- Audio clip (Microsoft start-up sound)

The figure below shows the participants' correctness in identifying cyber-attack.
