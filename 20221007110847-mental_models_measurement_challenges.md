Along with the many ways of measuring mental models (see
[[20220920093708-measuring_mental_models.md]],
[[20220919145732-mental_models.md]]), come many challenges in doing so. One of
the main challenges is that, like all other natural phenomena, mental models
are not static but evolve over time in response to changing conditions (Jones
et al., 2011). Any particular mental model may also be incomplete, and mental
models may compete with one another at any particular time when approaching a
particular task (Norman, 1983). Trying to measure an individual's mental model
runs the risk of distorting it (Richardson et al., 1994). People can appear to
be quite ad hoc in their verbal descriptions of mental models, combining
concepts and recent experience in a way where their understanding seems to
evolve as they speak (Payne, 1991).

Rowe and Cooke (1995) compared several different methods of eliciting mental
models, and their results are in line with the above that verbal think aloud
seemed to be a weak method, while diagramming and laddering performed better
(see 'measuring mental models' above).
