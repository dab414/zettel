A map of content for all things related to human security in cyber physical systems.

* Human security vulnerabilities in CPSs broadly:
    * What are the vulnerabilities? [[20220920102600-human_security_vulnerabilities_CPS]]
		* ie, What are the ways in which human decision making can increase the vulnerability of a CPS?
		* What is the awareness of these concerns by average people? [[20221016220734-cyber-physical_security_awareness]]
		* **What are the types of harm that can come from an attack on a CPS?**
			* [[cps attack harm]]
			* Physical, financial, privacy loss, property
			* Related to but not the same thing as attacker motivation
			* To do: 
				* keep brainstorming types of harm
				* compile types of harm for specific systems
				* see if we can extrapolate themes across them
    * What are the potential causes for the concerns? [[20220920111058-human_security_vulnerability_causes_CPS]]
    * What are the potential solutions? [[20220920115549-human_security_solutions_CPS.md]]
    * What are ways of and challenges with implementing the solutions? [[]]

* Human security concerns in specific CPSs:
    * Manufacturing [[20220919133525-human_security_concerns_manufacturing.md]]
    * General cyber security [[20221012143156-mental_models_security_roadblocks]]

* For coverage of security and mental models, see [[20221010113520-mental_models_and_security]]

* **Understanding people's concerns of CPS security vulnerabilities**
	* In addition to understanding the actual security vulnerabilities of CPS's, we want to understand what lay people *perceive* the vulnerabilities to be.
	* We are aiming to develop a scale to measure security concern of CPS's (see [[20221020144236-security_concern_scale_cyber_physical_systems]]).
	* See "Investigating generally across cyber physical systems" in [[20221013111824-research_questions]] and [[20221020144236-security_concern_scale_cyber_physical_systems]].
