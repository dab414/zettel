A map of content for all things related to human security in cyber physical systems.

* Human security vulnerabilities in CPSs broadly:
    * What are the vulnerabilities? [[20220920102600-human_security_vulnerabilities_CPS]]
		* ie, What are the ways in which human decision making can increase the vulnerability of a CPS?
		* What is the awareness of these concerns by average people? [[20221016220734-cyber-physical_security_awareness]]
    * What are the potential causes for the concerns? [[20220920111058-human_security_vulnerability_causes_CPS]]
    * What are the potential solutions? [[20220920115549-human_security_solutions_CPS.md]]
    * What are ways of and challenges with implementing the solutions? [[]]

* Human security concerns in specific CPSs:
    * Manufacturing [[20220919133525-human_security_concerns_manufacturing.md]]
    * General cyber security [[20221012143156-mental_models_security_roadblocks]]

* For coverage of security and mental models, see [[20221010113520-mental_models_and_security]]


## High priority aims (2022-10-19)

* **What are the types of harm that can come from an attack on a CPS?**
	* [[cps attack harm]]
	* Physical, financial, privacy loss, property
	* Related to but not the same thing as attacker motivation
	* To do: 
		* keep brainstorming types of harm
		* compile types of harm for specific systems
			* see if we can extrapolate themes across them

* **Understanding people's concerns of CPS security vulnerabilities**
	* Need to assess people's perception of the likelihood of an attack
		* Both generally and personally
	* *To get started:*
		* Compile any surveys / scales related to level of concern with security with other systems (eg, cyber).
			* Start a note that lists such scales
